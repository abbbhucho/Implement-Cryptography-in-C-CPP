As per Whatis.com <q>DES works by using the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message, so both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key. Once the go-to, symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data, DES has been superseded by the more secure Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.</q>
It is the short for Data Encryption Standard, a popular symmetric-key encryption method developed in 1975 and standardized by ANSI in 1981 as <u>ANSI X.3.92.</u> DES uses a 56-bit key and uses the block ciphermethod, which breaks text into 64-bit blocks and then encrypts them.

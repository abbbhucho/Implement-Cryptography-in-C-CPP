<h4>PLay Fair Cipher</h4>
<pre><p>invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, The Playfair cipher encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as is the case with simpler substitution ciphers such as the Caesar Cipher. The basic concept works on the priciple of first creating a 5 X 5 matrix.Thus taking all the mod 26 characters as per the english alphabet.
 The rules are:

If both letters are in the same column, take the letter below each one (going back to the top if at the bottom)
If both letters are in the same row, take the letter to the right of each one (going back to the left if at the farthest right)
If neither of the preceding two rules are true, form a rectangle with the two letters and take the letters on the horizontal opposite corner of the rectangle</p></pre>
